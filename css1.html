    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>

        <li>External - by using link element to link to an external CSS file .</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external
            CSS files . However ,<b class="bg">in this tutorial we will inline and internal styles ,</b> 
            because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself .

    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies
        a style to multiple element. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to 
        one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special
        URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS,selector are used to target a specific element or range of 
        elements on a web page. Once an elements has been targated, a 
        style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the 
        most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elemnts 
        to which a style should be applied.
