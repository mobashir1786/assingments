        PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values 
        X and Y and asks you to find the relation between them.
    The relationships between integers X and Y are as follows:
    .If X<Y, it means that X is smaller than Y
    .If X>Y, it means that X is greater than Y
    .If X=Y, it means that X is equal to Y. 
    Note: You have to complete findRelationship function. No need to take any input.

        const findRelation = (x,y) => {
            if( x < y){

        Find Grades
    Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student:  
    .if M≤10, the grade will be E
    .If 11≥M≤20, the grade will be D
    .If 21≥M≤30, the grade will be C
    .If 31≥M≤40, the grade will be B
    .If 41≥M≤50, the grade will be A.
    Your friend will enter his marks out of 50 , and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement.
