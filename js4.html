    Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by 
A
[
i
]
. 

She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment 
matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D.
You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.</pre>

   function Birthday_Game(arr,D ,M) {
     let counter = 0;
     for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++){
          let subArray = arr.slice(i, i+M);
          if (subArray.length === M) {
